# Quiz App

## Description

The main goal of this project is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will also have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
<br>
After completion of the project, I have a better understanding on declaring/calling variables, functions, arrow-functions, if-statments, callbacks and for loops. I also learned some better ways to refactor the JavaScript code, thus making the code easier to read and more modular!
