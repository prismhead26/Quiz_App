# Quiz App
To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 
## Description

The main goal of this project is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will also have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
<br>
After completion of the project, I have a better understanding on declaring/calling variables, functions, arrow-functions, if-statments, ternary operators and for loops. I also learned some better ways to refactor the JavaScript code, thus making the code easier to read and more modular!

## Features

JavaScript, variables, functions, if statements, ternary operators, DOM HTML, etc.
<br>
CSS, reset.
<br>
Basic HTML template with semantic elements.

## Tests

In order to test, run the program using the "Open with Live Server" Exstension.
<br>
I would also have DevTools open to see the logs.
<br>
There are also a few test logs in the console to help ensure the app is fully operable.
